# Semantic spotter project
## Problem Statement
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent hormonal disorder affecting a significant number of women of reproductive age, leading to various health complications, including infertility, metabolic issues, and psychological effects. Despite its prevalence, many women lack access to clear, concise, and accurate information regarding PCOS, its symptoms, and management strategies. This project aims to develop a robust generative search system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to effectively answer questions derived from authorised educational materials about PCOS. By leveraging LlamaIndex, the system will provide users with reliable, contextually relevant answers, enhancing their understanding and management of PCOS.

## Project Summary
This project involves the creation of a generative search application designed to assist users in obtaining accurate information about PCOS. Utilizing LlamaIndex, the application will implement a semantic search bot that retrieves and processes information from two comprehensive PDF documents. The system will employ RAG techniques to enhance the quality of responses by integrating external knowledge with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This approach ensures that users receive up-to-date and authoritative information, thereby improving their ability to manage PCOS effectively.
